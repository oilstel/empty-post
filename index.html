    <h2>Tell me more</h2>

    <p>We are planning a day of no social media called <a href="https://emptyday.today">Empty Day</a> on October 12, 2019. Because of this, we've had a lot of time to think about social media and the energy people put into it. We've noticed that many people use social media as a sort of public therapy. This is actually a good thing except that we as consumers of this media have to take in a flood of negativity from friends and loved ones. We thought it would be interesting to build a social network that didn't store anything and had no feed. A social media platform that is built for the moment!</p>

    <h2>Some ways of using this tool...</h2>

    <p>Try to post the worst thing you can think or something terrible about someone you dislike. Now post something that makes you happy or just a self-affirmation like, "I approve of myself." Don't judge what you write here. Just notice how you feel after each post.</p>

    <p>Post something nice about yourself every day. Always write in the present tense. "I am finacially stable" or "I am now in a better place." How do you feel after a week? Do you still need to post here? Do you still need to post on social media?</p>
    
    <h2>How do I know nothing is being stored?</h2>

    <p>Good question. We don't store anything entered in the field above but if you don't trust us please check out <a href="">the code for this site</a>.</p>

    <h2>Social media could be a more positive place</h2>

    <p>Although we are planning a day of no social media, we also would like to change the ways people use social media. What if you were more positive or sincere on social media? Would you feel better about yourself? What if you only followed people that you felt were pouring good energy into all their posts.</p>

    <p><i>We would love to know how you use this tool and if it helped you. Write us at email@emptyday.today.</i></p>
