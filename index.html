        <h2>Tell me more</h2>

        <p>We are planning a day of no social media called <a href="https://emptyday.today">Empty Day</a> on October 12, 2019. Because of this, we've had a lot of time to think about social media and the energy people put into it. We've noticed that many people use social media as a sort of public therapy. This is actually a good thing except that we are consuming a flood of negativity from our friends and loved ones. Taking in this energy reinforces the negative ways we think about ourselves and the world around us. We thought it would be interesting to build a social network that was the opposite of this. As you post, nothing is stored, and there's no feed to check. We like to think of it as a social media platform built for the moment!</p>

        <h2>Some ways of using this tool...</h2>

        <p>Try to post something that has been bothering you. Let it fade away. Now post something that makes you happy or just a self-affirmation like, "I approve of myself." Don't judge what you write. Just notice how you feel after each post.</p>

        <p>Post something nice about yourself every day. Always write in the present tense. How do you feel after a week? Do you still need to post here? Do you still need to post on social media?</p>
        
        <h2>How do I know nothing is being stored?</h2>

        <p>Good question. We don't store anything entered in the field above, but if you don't trust us please check out <a href="https://github.com/oilstel/empty-post">the code for this site</a>.</p>

        <h2>Social media could be a more positive place</h2>

        <p>Although we are planning a day of no social media, we would also like to change the ways people use social media. What if we were more positive or sincere on social media? Would we feel better about ourselves? What if we only followed people that were pouring good energy into all their posts.</p>

        <p><i>We would love to know how you use this platform and if it has helped you. Write us at email@emptyday.today. Email thoughts will be logged :-)</i></p>
