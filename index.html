        <h2>Tell me more</h2>

        <p>We have been busy planning a day no social media called <a href="https://emptyday.today">Empty Day</a> on October 12, 2019 and have had a lot of time to think about social media and the energy people put into it. We thought it would be interesting to build a social network that dissipates the energy that is put into it. As you post, nothing is stored, and there's no feed to check. We like to think of it as a social media platform built for the moment!</p>

        <h2>Some ways of using Empty Post</h2>

        <p>Try to post something thats been bothering you. Let it fade away. Now try to post something that makes you happy or a self-affirmation. Don't judge what you write. Just notice how you feel after each post.</p>

        <p>You could also try to post something nice about yourself every day. Always write in the present tense. Notice how you feel after a week. Do you still need to post here? Do you still need to post on social media?</p>
        
        <h2>How do I know nothing is being stored?</h2>

        <p>We don't store anything entered in the field above, but if you want to double check this website's code can be found at <a href="">here</a></p>

        <h2>We can change the way we think about social media</h2>

        <p>Although we are planning a day of no social media, we are also hoping to change the ways people use and think about social media. We've actually created <a href="https://2019.emtpyday.today/#assignments">several assignments</a> for using social media in interesting ways.</p>

        <p><i>We would love to know how you use Empty Post and if it helped you. Write us at email@emptyday.today. Note: You mail thoughts will be logged : )</i></p>
